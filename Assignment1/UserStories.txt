As a user I want to be able to shuffle cards so that the games will be different.
To do this we need to have a randomization function that changes the order of our arraylist.
Tests for this check to make sure the unshuffled deck has been passed in correctly,
all of the elements from the initial unshuffled deck are in the new shuffled deck,
and that the new shuffled deck has been properly returned so that it can be saved to where the original deck came from.

As a user I want to be able to deal cards so that each move can occur.
I will need to have a function that adds a card to the beginning of each arraylist within our 2D arraylist.
To test this we can check [0] of each of the four columns before and after dealing to make sure they differ.

Emily
As a user I want to be able to remove cards so that I can play.
There needs to be a function that checks if there are two cards of the same suit in the four [0] spots,
    [cont.] then make ensures that the one being removed is the smaller.
A test should check the [0] spots before and after a removal and make sure that they differ and that the logic was correct.

Jason
As a user I want to be able to know if I won or lost so that I can finally escape this game.
There needs to be a function that can determine if the deck is empty and what the current cards in position [0] are.
